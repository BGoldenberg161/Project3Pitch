### Project Overview
##### (Include project idea/concept, project name, who owns git master repo on github, team name [if desired], team member roles, elevator pitch)

Project Name: ApartMate
Roommate chores app with a spin. Doing chores is never fun, but each roommate likes to keep the house at a certain standard of living. Naturally this leads to some disagreement. Our app is designed to solve the neverending problem of chore responsibilities!
